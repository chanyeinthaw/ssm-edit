AWS SSM ParameterStore UI **SUCKS**! I made this to ease my pain. 

# AWS credentials

You need to configure aws credentials @ `~/.aws/credentials` or set `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` in env vars.

# Installation

```bash
bun add -g ssme
```

# Runing 

```bash
ssme --help
```

> You need `vim` by the way!
